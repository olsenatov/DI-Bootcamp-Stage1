            <li> James Potter was born on March 27, 1960 to Fleamont and Euphemia Potter.</li>
            <li> He was raised in a pampered household and grew up to be proud, arrogant, and boastful, but still a good person at heart.</li>
            <li> James attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was sorted into Gryffindor House.</li>
            <li> He became friends with <a href="sirius.html">Sirius Black</a>, <a href="remus.html">Remus Lupin</a>, and <a href="peter.html">Peter Pettigrew</a>, forming a group called <a href="story.html"> the Marauders</a>.</li>
            <li>James excelled in Quidditch and became the Chaser for the Gryffindor team. </li>
            <li>The Marauders discovered Remus Lupin's secret as a werewolf and learned to become Animagi to accompany him during his transformations.</li>
            <li>James perfected the transformation and became a stag Animagus, earning the nickname "Prongs."</li>
            <li>The Marauders created the Marauder's Map, which allowed them to navigate the Hogwarts grounds and avoid teachers.</li>
            <li>James had a rivalry with <a href="snape.html">Severus Snape</a>, which started from their first meeting on the Hogwarts Express.</li>
            <li>He pursued <a href="lily.html">Lily Evans</a>, but she initially found him arrogant and obnoxious, changing her mind later on.</li>
            <li>James and Lily got married after graduating from Hogwarts and joined the Order of the Phoenix to fight against Voldemort.</li>
            <li>They defied Voldemort's attempts to recruit them three times.</li>
            <li>James inherited the Potter family fortune and used it to support his family and Remus.</li>
            <li>James and Lily went into hiding when Lily became pregnant with their son, Harry.</li>
            <li>They used the Fidelius Charm and made Peter Pettigrew their Secret-Keeper, but he betrayed them to Voldemort.</li>
            <li>James sacrificed himself to give Lily and Harry time to escape when Voldemort attacked their home on October 31, 1981.</li>
            <li>Voldemort murdered James, but Lily's sacrifice protected Harry and rebounded Voldemort's curse, resulting in his defeat and Harry becoming "the Boy Who Lived."</li>
